**Overview**

The Python Calculator is an interactive console application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It allows continuous calculations (chaining results) and provides a clean user interface through text-based interaction.
This project demonstrates my understanding of function-based design, data structures, and program flow control in Python.

Learning Objectives & Technical Implementation

This project helped me strengthen my knowledge of core programming principles and apply them to create a real, functional tool.

**Concept &	Description**

1. Functions for Reusability - Implemented arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) as separate reusable functions.
2. Dictionaries for Operation Mapping -	Used a Python dictionary to map operator symbols (+, -, *, /) to their corresponding functions.
3. Loops for Continuous Operation -	Designed a while loop that allows users to continue calculations without restarting the program.
4. User Input Handling - Practiced using input() and typecasting with float() for numeric inputs.
5. Formatted Output - Displayed results with readable expressions (e.g., 5 * 3 = 15).
6. Modular Design & Readability -	Structured the code with clear functions and logical flow for maintainability.
7. Importing Custom Modules -	Utilized a custom art module to display a creative logo and improve user experience.

By completing this project, I gained stronger control over Python syntax, data structures, and interactive program design.


**Example Interaction**

Welcome to the Python Calculator!
What is the first number?: 12
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: *
What is the next number?: 4
12 * 4 = 48
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 48, or 'n' to start a new calculation: y
Pick an operation: +
What is the next number?: 2
48 + 2 = 50
